# GovTech-Assignment

NOTE: I have coded and tested my files using Visual Studio Code

How to run the code:

1. Open my govtech_github folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Ensure that the working directory is Govtech-Assignment
3. Open up a Command Prompt Terminal in Visual Studio Code
4. Type "compile.bat" into the terminal and press enter
5. Type "run.bat" into the terminal and press enter

Logic Testing
The primary method that runs the code logic is balanceAccounts, which is in src/main/BalanceUtil.java. 
I have used src/test/TestCases.java to run the provided logic test cases for BalanceUtil.java

Unit Testing:
I have implemented JUnit Jupiter to unit test the methods of src/main/Person.java. 

To install JUnit on Visual Studio Code: 
1. Click on Testing (the conical flask) on the left sidebar
2. Click "Enable Java Tests"
3. A search bar will pop up, click on JUnit Jupiter
4. JUnit Jupiter will start installing

The unit testing file is src/test/PersonTest.java
